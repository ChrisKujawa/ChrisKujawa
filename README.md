# Christopher Kujawa (born as Zell)

I'm a passionate software engineer who has been working in open source for more than 10 years now, mainly at [@Camunda](https://github.com/camunda), where I have worked on and bootstrapped several projects. 
For example, I was a core contributor for many years as a Distributed Systems and Chaos Engineer on the fault-tolerant, high-performing, and scalable processing engine [Zeebe](https://camunda.com/platform/zeebe/).

I am highly interested in distributed systems, chaos engineering, reliability, quality, and SRE topics.
Right now, I'm working as a Principal Software Engineer, ensuring the reliability and performance of our platform, so that we can find issues before our users and customers do and confidently ship the product. I always drive to improve our internal processes, especially with respect to IRM. For this, I introduced Gamedays [@Camunda](http://camunda.com) to train ourselves and find sharp edges in our procedures.

During my time [@Camunda](http://camunda.com), I bootstrapped several pet/side projects and initiatives, most of which I'm still maintaining.

 * [Zbchaos - chaos toolkit for Zeebe](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos)
   * Covering a lot of chaos engineering topics regarding Zeebe, for example, a CLI to inject failures and run experiments
   * Hosting a blog where I publish semi-regular Chaos Day summaries on my [Zeebe Chaos Blog](https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/)
 * [Zeebe Benchmark Helm charts](https://github.com/zeebe-io/benchmark-helm)
   * Containing a Helm Chart based on the Camunda Platform Helm chart and adding load test capabilities for Camunda 8.
 * [C# Zeebe client](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp)
   * Containing a C#/.NET Client based on the gRPC Camunda protocol.
 * [Zeebe Debug and inspection tool (zdb)](https://github.com/Zelldon/zdb)
   * Containing a CLI to inspect the internal state and log of the Zeebe processing engine, frequently used in incidents and support cases. 
 * [Camunda Cloud Helm charts](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-cloud-helm)
   * I bootstrapped the Camunda Platform Helm chart and handed it to our now Distributions team.
 * [Embedded Zeebe Engine (eze)](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/eze)
   * The embedded Zeebe engine, which can be used for performance or general unit tests, makes process tests much faster.

I have written several blog posts in the past since I like to share my learnings and knowledge:
