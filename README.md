Hi there :wave:, my name is Christopher Zell I'm a passionated software engineer working in open source since almost 10 years. I'm mainly working on the [Zeebe Project](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe) as Distributed Systems Engineer. I have high interest in distributed systems, chaos engineering and SRE topics. 

As side projects I'm maintaining the following projects:

 * [C# Zeebe client](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp)
 * [Zeebe Debug and insepection tool](https://github.com/Zelldon/zdb)
 * [Camunda Cloud helm charts](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-cloud-helm)
 * [Embedded Zeebe Engine](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/eze)

As I have high interest in chaos engineering I created an [repository](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos) which covers a lot of chaos engineering in regards to Zeebe. I publish semi-regularly Chaos Day summaries on my [Zeebe Chaos Blog](https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/). I introduced Game Days in Camunda to make our systems more reliable and gave a talk about this topic at [Camunda Con 2020.2](https://page.camunda.com/cclive-zell-chaosengineeringmeetszeebe).
