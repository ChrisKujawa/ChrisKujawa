My name is Christopher Kujawa (former Zell).

I'm a passionate software engineer working in open source for almost 10 years. I'm mainly working on the [Zeebe Project](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe) as a Distributed Systems and Chaos Engineer. I have a high interest in distributed systems, chaos engineering, and SRE topics. 

During my time [@Camunda](camunda.com) I bootstrapped several projects, most of which I'm still maintaining.

 * [C# Zeebe client](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp)
 * [Zeebe Debug and insepection tool (zdb)](https://github.com/Zelldon/zdb)
 * [Camunda Cloud Helm charts](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-cloud-helm)
 * [Zeebe Benchmark Helm charts](https://github.com/zeebe-io/benchmark-helm)
 * [Embedded Zeebe Engine (eze)](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/eze)
 * [Zbchaos - chaos toolkit for Zeebe](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos)

As I have a high interest in chaos engineering I created an [repository](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos) which covers a lot of chaos engineering in regards to Zeebe. I publish semi-regular Chaos Day summaries on my [Zeebe Chaos Blog](https://zeebe-io.github.io/zeebe-chaos/). I have introduced Game Days in Camunda to make our systems more reliable and gave a talk about this topic at [Camunda Con 2020.2](https://page.camunda.com/cclive-zell-chaosengineeringmeetszeebe).

I have written several blog posts in the past since I like to share my learnings and knowledge:
